# BBC Accessibility Standards Checker

This tool runs a set of tests against a set of URLs to verify whether each one
meets the [BBC accessibility
standards](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/).

This project is a work in progress, but it is stable and you can use it to
test the accessibility of your website, or add use it in your web project
today.
