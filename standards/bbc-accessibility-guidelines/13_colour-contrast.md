# All content must meet minimum contrast standard

All colour combinations **must** pass the WCAG 2.0 AA-compliant colour contrast check in accordance with the [Snook colour contrast checker](http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html).

This is a ratio of 4.5:1 for text 18pt or less in size, and 3:1 for text larger than 18pt or text that is bold and larger than 14pt.

Where it cannot be adapted, stylised text used in pre-existing broadcast logos and branding is exempt from this requirement.

## Rationale

If there is sufficient contrast between foreground and background colours, particularly between text and its background but also applicable to the keys of graphs and similar, then users with moderately low vision or with colour deficiencies that affect contrast to a minor degree are more likely to be able to access BBC content without requiring additional assistive technologies.

## Notes

This (and every other test that requires checking a large number of elements and their properties) would be best run as part of the 'full' test set, and have a 'quick' test set for any standards that are quick to test.
