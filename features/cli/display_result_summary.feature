Feature: Display result summary

  Scenario: Summarises pages checked and standard results
    Given a website running on localhost
    And a file named "a11y.js" with:
      """
      page("http://localhost:54321/perfect.html")
      page("http://localhost:54321/missing_main_heading.html", {
        skip: "Structure: Headings: Exactly one main heading"
      })
      page("http://localhost:54321/missing_main_heading.html?again!")
      page("http://localhost:54321/subheading_first.html")
      """
    When I run `bbc-a11y`
    Then it should fail with:
      """
      4 pages checked, 1 error found, 1 warning, 1 standard skipped
      """

  Scenario: Reminds users to consider usability beyond lint results
    Given a website running on localhost
    When I run `bbc-a11y http://localhost:54321/perfect.html`
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      No errors found. But please remember:
