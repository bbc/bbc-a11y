  @config
  Scenario: One standard is skipped
    Given a website running at http://localhost:54321
    And a file named ".a11y" with:
      """
      page http://localhost:54321/missing_header.html
      skip Headings: exactly one main heading
      """
    When I run `a11y`
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      âœ“ http://localhost:54321/missing_header.html
      """

  @config

      skip Headings: exactly one main heading
      """
    When I run `a11y`

      """
