Feature: Mute errors

  Things like ORB and Barlesque that we don't control will clutter up our pages
  with violations.

  We need a way to ignore these kinds of problems, so
  we can focus on the problems that we can actually fix.

  Questions:

  - how can we ignore / remove specific areas of the page? What are some
    real examples?

  Scenario: Mute any errors from a specific standard
