Feature: Title attributes

  `title` attributes **must not** be used for critical information and **must
  not** repeat content that is already visible and associated with the same
  control or content.

  Rationale
  =========

  `title` attributes are inaccessible to keyboard users without additional
  Assistive Technology. They are dependent on user settings in Screen Readers
  and similar Assistive Technology.

  Additionally they suffer from discoverability problems: pointing device users
  are required to hover over page elements and pause before the title tooltip
  displays, usually with no indication that there is additional content to be
  displayed.

  Repeating content in visible text and `title` attributes can lead to content
  clutter and repeated phrases.

  Key recommendations are:

  - Do not use the `title` attribute unless on a form input as title text is not
    well supported on links on mobile
  - Do not use `title` attributes and explicit labels together on form fields

  Scenario: Form field with title attribute
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <button type="button" title="Close Button">
        <img src="close.png" />
      </button>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes only on inputs" standard
    Then it passes

  Scenario: Hidden element with title attribute
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <iframe style="display:none" title="Ignore me, I'm invisible"></iframe>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes only on inputs" standard
    Then it passes

  Scenario: Anchor tag with title attribute
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <a href="close" title="Close Button">
        <img src="close.png" />
      </a>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes only on inputs" standard
    Then it fails with the message:
      """
      Non-input element has title attribute: /html/body/a
      """

  Scenario: Iframe tag with title attribute
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <iframe src="perfect.html" title="Rainbows and unicorns"></iframe>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes only on inputs" standard
    Then it passes

  Scenario: Title attribute duplicates content
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <a href="back" title="Back to Home">
        <img src="back.png" /> Back to Home
      </a>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes must not duplicate content" standard
    Then it fails with the message:
      """
      Title attribute duplicates content: /html/body/a
      """

  Scenario: Title attribute duplicates nested content
    Given a page with the body:
      """
      <a href="back" title="Back to Home">
        <span>Back to <b>Home</b></span>
      </a>
      """
    When I validate the "Title attributes: Title attributes must not duplicate content" standard
    Then it fails with the message:
      """
      Title attribute duplicates content: /html/body/a
      """
