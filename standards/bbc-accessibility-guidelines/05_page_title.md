# Page title

  A document **must** have a unique page `<title>` that identifies its main content.

  Rationale
  =========

  Document titles help users orientate themselves within web sites and apps. The document `<title>` element
  content is often the first thing a speech output user will hear and acts as a confirmation of what page they
  have arrived at. Document titles commonly have the same content as the main `<h1>` element.

  Techniques
  ==========

  Pass:
