Feature: Core Purpose

  Rationale
  =========

  While our aim is for all users to have access to all features of BBC apps and
  sites we recognise that technology both restricts and extends what is
  possible.

  Additionally GEL is aimed providing the best experience to the broadest range
  of users, and while it should not discriminate against users with access needs
  nor does it give special privilege.

  The aim of this guideline is to provide the most accessible base line
  experience for the core purpose across the broadest range of technology.

  See the following standards for examples of when a defined core purpose is
  applicable:

    * Progressive enhancement

    * Minimum text size

  It is not a reason to ignore accessibility for non-core page elements.
