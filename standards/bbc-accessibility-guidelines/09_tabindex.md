# Use `tabindex` attributes

  Positive `tabindex` attribute values **must not** be used to create a logical tab order.

  `tabindex` values of `0` **must not** be used on elements that are not focusable by default.

  Rationale
  =========

  Typical BBC pages are made up of several shared components (Global navigation, page content, share tools,
  location service widgets, etc.) so no one piece of code has complete awareness of the content of the page
  or when the content updates. Positive `tabindex` values results in unpredictable tab order that do not occur
  if the natural order of content is relied upon.

  Using `tabindex="0"` on an element adds it to the document tab order, however it does not change the element
  type to allow it to be discovered by navigating by link or form element, nor does it bind click and key press
  handlers to the element. There are no circumstances in which it is not better to use a natively focusable
  control such as a `<a>` or `<button>`.

  Techniques
  ==========

  Pass:

    <a href="/news">News</a>

    <button type="submit">Search</button>

    <div tabindex="-1"></div>

  Fail:

    <a href="/news" tabindex="1">

    <button type="submit" tabindex="2">Search</button>

    <div tabindex="3"></div>

    <div tabindex="0"></div>
