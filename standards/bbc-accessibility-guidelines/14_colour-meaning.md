# Information must not be conveyed by colour alone

Information conveyed with colour **must** also be identifiable from context or markup.

## Rationale

Users who are blind, have low vision, or have colour blindness may not be able to differentiate content (lines on a chart) or states (selected tabs) if colour alone is used.

Alternatives must be provided for both sighted and non-sighted users, for example a table equivalent of a chart and lines differentiable with different styles (dashed, dotted, etc.).
