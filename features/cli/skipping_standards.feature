Feature: Skipping Standards

  Scenario: One standard is skipped
    Given a website running at http://localhost:54321
    And a file named "a11y.js" with:
      """
      page("http://localhost:54321/missing_header.html", {
        skip: "Headings: exactly one main heading"
      })
      """
    When I run `bbc-a11y`
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      âœ“ http://localhost:54321/missing_header.html
      """

  Scenario: All standards except one is skipped
    Given a website running at http://localhost:54321
    And a file named "a11y.js" with:
      """
      page("http://localhost:54321/two_headings_failures.html", {
        only: "Headings: exactly one main heading"
      })
      """
    When I run `bbc-a11y`
    Then it should fail with:
      """
      1 page checked, 1 error found, 11 standards skipped
      """
