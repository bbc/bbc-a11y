# The core purpose of every document must be defined

Before design and implementation of a document or feature its core purpose **must** be defined.

## Definitions

### Core purpose

The functionality to inform, educate, and entertain without which there would be no purpose for site or document.

## Rationale

While our aim is for all users to have access to all features of BBC apps and sites we recognise that technology both restricts and extends what is possible.

Additionally GEL is aimed providing the best experience to the broadest range of users, and while it should not discriminate against users with access needs nor does it give special privilege.

The aim of this guideline is to provide the most accessible base line experience for the core purpose across the broadest range of technology.

See the following standards for examples of when a defined core purpose is applicable:

- [Core experience must not rely on JavaScript or CSS]()
- [Minimum text size]()

It is **not** a reason to ignore accessibility for non-core page elements.
