Feature: Form interactions

  Forms must have a submit button and forms must not update the location of the
  page on change, focus, or blur events.

  All `<form>` elements that take user input (i.e. do not consist only of
  `input[type=hidden]` elements to store state) **must** have a submit button in
  the form of a `<input>[type=submit,image]` or `<button>[type=submit]` element.

  Changes to the page **must** location must only take place on explicit user
  action i.e. when a submit button is activated. They must not take place when
  change (particularly for `select` elements), focus, or blur events are fired.

  Rationale
  =========

  All forms should have a submit button to provide a clear call to action. This
  is particularly important to users with cognitive disabilities, but is also
  beneficial to low vision users as an indication of the end of the form.
