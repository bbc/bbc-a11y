Feature: Exit status

  For CI, we need to make sure the process exits with a non-zero
  status when there's been a failure.

  Scenario: Passing tests
    When all the tests pass
    Then the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Failing test
    Given a website running at http://localhost:54321
    When I run `bbc-a11y http://localhost:54321/missing_header.html`
    Then the exit status should be 1
